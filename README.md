# Elastic Maps Landing Page


The Elastic Maps Landing Page is a previewer of the data of the Elastic Maps Service.

## Development

The page is designed as a single-page application. It loads the root manifest from EMS using a cross-domain call.

### Prerequisites

`Yarn` is used as the package manager for this project. Ensure both `node` and `yarn` are installed on your system.

### Running the page locally

#### Install dependencies

> yarn install

#### Start the babel compilation and watch task

> yarn dev

Keep this running. The javascript/css will be automatically recompiled when files change.

#### Open the page

`public/index.html`

You can run the page either from the file-system or any dev-server.

## Package the app.
